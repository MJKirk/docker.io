Docker files for EOS - A HEP Program for Flavor Observables
===========================================================

This repository keeps track of the source files used to create Docker images for EOS.
Presently we keep track of the [build-essential](https://hub.docker.com/r/eoshep/build-essentials/) images,
which have all build-time dependencies pre-installed.

We welcome bug fixed and additions.
